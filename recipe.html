<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
<p>Melted cheese between two pieces of toasted golden bread. The classic and simple grilled cheese sandwich can be reimagined multiple ways just by changing up the bread and cheese. Fine-tuneing this classic and the result is the perfect grilled cheese sandwich.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 Slices, of thick cut bread of your choice such as White, Rye, Brioche, Sourdough, Potato, Whole wheat or Pumpernickel. </li>
    <li>2 ounces shredded cheese (for each sandwich), such as American, Cheddar, Muenster, Havarti, Swiss, Fontina, Mozzarella, Monterey jack, Pepper jack or Provolone.</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of fat such as mayonnaise, unsalted butter (soft, room temp.), (or 1/2 a tbsp. of each, butter and mayo for a combo), or olive, chili or coconut oil. </li>
    <li>A toaster (set to medium, this step will help cut down on cook time while making it the perfect texture of crisp with less absorbed grease in your sandwich.)</li>
    <li>A butter knife and/or pastry brush</li>
    <li>A sharp knife</li>
    <li>A cutting board</li>
    <li>A cheese grater</li>
    <li>A spatula</li>
    <li>A skillet</li>
    <li>A small bowl</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
<ol>
    <li>On a cutting board shred/grate your choice of cheese and place on the side. Do not use pre-shredded cheese as it has a anti-caking coating on it and does not lend to melting well. </li>
    <li>In a small bowl, mix mayonnaise and butter (or your choice of fat) until fully combined/stirred.</li>
    <li>Toast your choice of thick cut sliced bread in the toaster on the medium setting. </li>
    <li>After toast is done in the toaster, assembly sandwiches by brushing/spreading the butter-mayo mixture (or your choice of fat) on one side of each piece of bread, to the very edges.</li>
    <li>On the inside of the bread of your choice, add shredded/grated cheese (2 oz. for each sandwich) and top with second piece of bread that is prepared with the same butter/mayo combo (or fat of your choice).</li>
    <li>Add prepared sandwich to a cold skillet and turn heat on to low.</li>
    <li>Carefully watch to make sure that you arenâ€™t burning the butter-mayo (or fat of your choice), press down on sandwich with the spatula to help even the browning but don't smash it down, flip as soon as one side is golden brown and continue with other side.</li>
    <li>This process should take 4-6 min on each side (8-10 mins. if you skip toaster step).</li>
    <li>Do not rush this process or you will compromise the crispy golden crust of a perfect grilled cheese.</li>
    <li>Once both sides are golden brown, transfer out of skillet and let cool, a minimum of 2 plus minutes (as to avoid burning your mouth with scolding hot cheese, it will be worth your wait) and with a sharp knife, slice on a diagonal then enjoy!</li>
